# Docker for Ding

Still unpolished and in the works.

## Prerequisites

This project assumes that the following software is installed and working on your machine:

- [Docker and docker-compose](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
- [Drush 8.x](http://docs.drush.org/en/8.x/install/)

## Preparation

Clone this repository
```sh
% git clone https://github.com/reload/ding-docker.git
% cd ding-docker
```

Get a ding make file
```sh
% curl -LOSs https://raw.github.com/ding2/ding2/master/drupal.make
```

Build the site with drush make:
```sh
% drush make --contrib-destination=profiles/ding2/ drupal.make web --working-copy
```

Then you can start the Docker containers:
```sh
% docker-compose up
```

### Using a custom version of the codebase

To use a custom version of the code base then first complete the steps above. add your fork as a remote to the profile and checkout your branch:

```sh
% cd web/profiles/ding2
% git remote add [remote name] [remote repository url]
% git fetch [remote name]
% git checkout -t [remote name]/[remote branch]
```

In the following example we work with the `master` branch from the Reload fork of Ding2:

```sh
% cd web/profiles/ding2
% git remote add reload git@github.com:reload/ding2.git
% git fetch reload
% git checkout -t reload/master
```


Note that you may have to clear the cache, download new dependencies or even reinstall the site to make the changes take effect.

## Install ding

Running the install profile can sometimes be tricky.

The sure-fire way (especially on Mac) is to run the install script through the browser:
http://local.docker/install.php (Use the ding2 profile)

Notice: This way can be pretty slow.


A faster way is to run the install-script through Drush inside the `php` container:
```sh
% docker-compose exec php drush site-install ding2
```

## Stuff not polished yet

* memcache setup
* varnish only one way
* the drush container does not have access to the SOAP connection that the web container has. This makes it fail on site-install sometimes
